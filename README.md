It's a simple app to track time spent on various things along the day.

Tasks and times are saved locally on a sqlite3 database, no cloud needed.

## Features

Currently the functionality to add tasks, count time, edit task description and task delete is handled.

## TODO

Grouping by day, basic reporting, attaching a "project" to tasks, etc.

Help welcome.

Electron, electron-builder vue addon, knex (sqlite3), ForkAwesome, Bootstrap, moment, electron-store (preferences), and probably some more.
